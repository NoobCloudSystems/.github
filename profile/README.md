# NoobCloud - discontinued

NoobCloud was a Minecraft cloudsystem especially for Minestom. The main intention of this project was to educate myself.
It was never really intended to be used in a production environment.

I have come to the conclusion that there is no longer any point in continuing this project as there are better alternatives.
All in all, it was a cool and exciting project, thank you for your interest and support.
